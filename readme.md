What's the weather here, or there, or anywhere in the U.S.?

## Installation

```

## Usage
```sh
# Get current weather as well as a 5-day forecast

There are two prompts:
1. Celsius or Fahrenheit (enter either c, celsius, f, or fahrenheit).
2. Enter the U.S. Zip Code you want to see the weather for.

That's it. Enjoy!
